# w19Cart
products in a cart with restocking.  added stock subtracting functionality. 

## Improvements yet to come:  styling the UI, adding alerts when a requested item is out of stock (something like "Sold Out! none left in stock, please wait for a restock and come back in a few days"), make the cart items tally instead of just list single products, and lastly of course send the user to the next stage to pay the pill and handle the shipping after "checkout" is clicked.
